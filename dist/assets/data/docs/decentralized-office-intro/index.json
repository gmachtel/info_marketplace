These solutions range from the popular Microsoft Office (estimated to be used by <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/there-are-now-12-billion-office-users-60-million-office-365-commercial-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over a billion people worldwide</a>) and its competitors (like Google Docs) to Slack and other collaboration tools to project management software like Monday.com.</p>\n<p>The current set of online collaboration tools created by the leading cloud companies are available in two forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For a commercial fee.</strong> Mostly used by businesses because they provide a private environment, and software users and content are not used to harvest data from.</li>\n<li><strong>Free of charge.</strong> Mostly used by individuals in private situations. Here various terms and conditions allow the service providers to capture usage information and use this information to improve the product, but also sell this information to third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ThreeFold believes that there should be a private and secure version of those applications available to anyone at an affordable price without data harvesting.</p>\n<!---\n\n![](./img/office_word.png)\n\n### A brief overview of \"Office\"\n\n- The term \"Office\" refers to a family of software which allows people to create documents, spreadsheets and presentations. The term was introduced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of productivity applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration, and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. \n\n- Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. On July 10, 2012, Softpedia reported that Office was being used by over a billion people worldwide.\n\n- Office (Microsoft) has been very successful to become the standard for people, students, and businesses to create and collaborate on documents. Over the years the office product suite moved from a local install to an online version (Office 365) and a number of other products have come to market to challenge that leading position (the Google Docs suite being the largest competitor).\n","sidebar":"docs","next":"/docs/dmcircles/","prev":"/docs/commento/","headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"Intro","anchor":"#intro"},{"depth":2,"value":"Decentralized Office brings safe & secure collaboration with teams","anchor":"#decentralized-office-brings-safe--secure-collaboration-with-teams"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/docs/zeroci/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/wiki-publisher/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/virtual-spaces/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/video-sharing/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/video-conf/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/tomochain/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/tfgrid/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/serverless/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/publishing-tool/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/index/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/harmony/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/gridsome/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/gitea/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/dmcustomers/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/dmcollab/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/dmcircles/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/digitalme/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/decentralized-office-intro/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/digibyte/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/dash/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/commento/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/crystaltwin/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/blog-publisher/img/readme/","title":""}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/zeroci/","title":"Continuous Integration Tool"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/wiki-publisher/","title":"Wiki Publisher"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/why-threefold-now/","title":"Why ThreeFold Now?"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/waykichain/","title":"WaykiChain"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/virtual-spaces/","title":"Virtual Spaces"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/video-sharing/","title":"Video Sharing"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/video-conf/","title":"Video Chat"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/upcoming-projects/","title":"Coming Up!"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/tomochain/","title":"TomoChain"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/tfgrid/","title":"The ThreeFold Grid"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/stellar/","title":"Stellar"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/skalelabs/","title":"SKALE Network"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/serverless/","title":"Serverless App Framework"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/publishing-tool/","title":"Publishing Tools"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/neo/","title":"NEO"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/mattermost/","title":"Team Collaboration"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/matic/","title":"Matic Network"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/knowledge-base/","title":"Knowledge Base"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/how-threefold-now/","title":"How to use ThreeFold Now"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/harmony/","title":"Harmony"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/gridsome/","title":"Modern Site Generator"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/gitea/","title":"Git Service"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/elrond/","title":"Elrond"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/dmcustomers/","title":"CRM"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/dmcollab/","title":"Office Tools"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/dmcircles/","title":"Project Management"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/discourse/","title":"Community Forum"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/digitalme-id/","title":"DigitalMe ID"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/digibyte/","title":"DigiByte"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/digitalme/","title":"Intro (DigitalMe)"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/decentralized-we-intro/","title":"Intro"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/decentralized-dev-intro/","title":"Intro"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/decentralized-office-intro/","title":"Intro"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/decentralized-bc-intro/","title":"Intro"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/dash/","title":"Dash"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/crystaltwin/","title":"Crystal Twin"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/commento/","title":"Comments Widget"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/blog-publisher/","title":"Blog Publisher"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/","title":"What Is ThreeFold Now?"}}]}},"context":{}}
