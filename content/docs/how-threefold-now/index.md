To deploy a solution on TF NOW Marketplace, there are some pre-requisites that need to be done:

1. Get ThreeFold Connect App; ThreeFold Connect is a mobile app that facilitate you with your own 3Bot Wallet where and 3Bot ID; your digital identity on top of the ThreeFold Grid.

2. Get and store TFT into your TF Connect Wallet to reserve IT Capacity and pay for your workload on top of the TF Grid. Click [here](hhttps://manual2.threefold.io/#/mainnet_gettft) to read more on how to get and store TFT on the manual.

3. Deploy an eVDC (testnet, mainnet coming soon). ThreeFold Now Marketplace is running as one of the main features of [TF eVDC](vdc.threefold.io). You would need to create an eVDC account to deploy and manage your TF Now solutions. Click [here](https://manual2.threefold.io/#/evdc_deployer) to read more on how to get and store TFT on the manual.

## On your eVDC Admin Panel, you can now deploy a TF Now Marketplace Solution.

- After an eVDC is successfully deployed, you'll need to log in through ThreeFold Connect, an authenticator for the eVDC.
- On your eVDC Admin Panel, you will see solutions organized into various categories.
- Simply choose the solution you want to deploy from the admin panel screen.

## Next, use the guided setup to create your solution

- Each solution has its own flow â€“ actions in order to deploy your own instance on top of the ThreeFold Grid.
- If you're feeling lost, each live tool has a tutorial on its page here on the wiki.
