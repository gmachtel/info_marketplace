# Intro

## Decentralized Office brings safe & secure collaboration with teams

In a world that is going more and more remote when it comes to work, we increasingly rely on tools that allow us to collaborate and co-create from afar. These solutions range from the popular Microsoft Office (estimated to be used by [over a billion people worldwide](https://www.windowscentral.com/there-are-now-12-billion-office-users-60-million-office-365-commercial-customers)) and its competitors (like Google Docs), to Slack and other collaboration tools, to project management software like Monday.com.

The current set of online collaboration tools created by the leading cloud companies are available in two forms:

- **For a commercial fee.** Mostly used by businesses because they provide a private environment, and software users and content are not used to harvest data from.
- **Free of charge.** Mostly used by individuals in private situations. Here various terms and conditions allow the service providers to capture usage information and use this information to improve the product, but also sell this information to third parties.

ThreeFold believes that there should be a private and secure version of those applications available to anyone at an affordable price and without data harvesting.
