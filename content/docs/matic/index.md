## Joint Mission

Distributing Matic's Blockchain across the edges.

## About Matic Network

**[Matic Network](https://matic.network/)**  is a decentralized scalability platform solution using an adapted version of the Plasma framework that empowers Ethereum-based DApps with the high-speed and extremely low-cost transactions required to achieve mass adoption. With 60+ DApps building on their network already, Matic Network is one of the most widely adopted DApp platforms in the industry.  The Matic Network blockchain achieves finality using PoS checkpoints which are pushed to the Ethereum mainchain. This enables a single Matic sidechain to theoretically achieve 65535 transactions per block, and possibly millions of transactions on multiple chains in the future
