# Discourse

![](./img/discourse.png)

*You can access Discourse on the ThreeFold Now Marketplace directly [here](https://marketplace.threefold.io/marketplace/#/solutions/discourse).*

## What is Discourse?

[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) is modern forum software for your community. Use it as a mailing list, discussion forum, long-form chat room, and more!

## Why use Discourse?

We are big fans of Discourse and actually use it for [our forum](https://forum.threefold.io). But why do we love Discourse? Here are a few reasons:

- It's 100% open source which means we're able to bring it as a solution on ThreeFold Now!
- The trust system allows the community to easily defend itself from trolls and spammers — and the most engaged forum members can assist in the community's governance. This one is an important differentiator based on our own experience on other platforms.
- Discourse is simple, easy, and well-organized – and has great experiences on desktop and on mobile

Bonus! Discourse has integration features with [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/), which is also part of the ThreeFold Now suite.
