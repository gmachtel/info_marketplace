# CryptPad

*You can access CryptPad on the ThreeFold Now Marketplace directly [here](https://marketplace.threefold.io/marketplace/#/solutions/cryptpad).*

## Why CryptPad?

Many alternatives are available to the the dominant office tools from Microsoft and Google, but ThreeFold endorses and supports the CryptPad.fr open-source CryptPad project.

- [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/what-is-cryptpad.html) is a private-by-design alternative to popular office tools and cloud services.
- It has most of the same crucial functionalities you would be used to with existing tools.
- More importantly, all the content stored on CryptPad is encrypted before being sent, which means nobody can access your data unless you give them the keys (not even us).
- Encryption happens in the browser that is used to access the "pads" â€“ and therefore the central storage facility used does not see un-encrypted data and only sees encrypted data passing by.

The ThreeFold team uses it for internal documents and collaboration, and now so can end-users on the ThreeFold Grid. The functionality includes:

## A rich text editor

This is an alternative to Word and Google Docs. It allows you to create documents and to collaborate with others to co-create documents, as CryptPad supports multi-user access to documents for co-editing and collaborations. The sharing facility uses unique access keys allowing other to see the content un-encrypted.
