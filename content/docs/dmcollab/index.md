Nearly everyone that uses a computer for work is using some type of Office solution whether it be through Microsoft or Google or both. So this solution was a no-brainer.

## Open Source Solution: CryptPad

Many alternatives are available to the the dominant office tools from Microsoft and Google, but ThreeFold endorses and supports the [CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) open-source CryptPad project – a private-by-design alternative.

## Why Cryptpad?

- It has most of the same crucial functionalities you would be used to with existing tools.
- More importantly, all the content stored on CryptPad is encrypted before being sent, which means nobody can access your data unless you give them the keys (not even us).
- Encryption happens in the browser that is used to access the "pads" – and therefore the central storage facility used does not see un-encrypted data and only sees encrypted data passing by.

The ThreeFold team uses it for internal documents and collaboration, and now so can end-users on the ThreeFold Grid. The functionality includes:

## A rich text editor

This is an alternative to Word and Google Docs. It allows you to create documents and to collaborate with others to co-create documents, as CryptPad supports multi-user access to documents for co-editing and collaborations. The sharing facility uses unique access keys allowing other to see the content un-encrypted.
