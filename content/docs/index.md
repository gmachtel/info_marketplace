# What Is ThreeFold Now?

**ThreeFold has created the largest active peer-to-peer cloud on the planet — but the Internet is more than just storage and capacity. To fully realize the vision of an Internet built for everyone, by everyone, we need easy-to-use and easy-to-deploy alternatives to the online tools and applications we use most.**

From publishing to video hosting, communication to project management, ThreeFold has developed a suite of turnkey solutions for anyone to create, share, and build on the decentralized and secure [ThreeFold Grid](https://threefold.io).

Many more solutions will be added in the future. ThreeFold Now is a marketplace that will continue to grow, a marketplace of decentralized applications that will set us free.

**The Internet of tomorrow, available today — this is [ThreeFold Now](https://marketplace.threefold.io).**

*Please note that ThreeFold Now is currently operating in demo mode on testnet. Your deployments will be cancelled after three hours automatically.*

*The tools still require some technical know-how, but 1. we have tutorials tied to each live solution and 2. are very happy with progress until today. We firmly believe there is nothing else out there like ThreeFold Now.*
