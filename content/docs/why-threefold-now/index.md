# Why ThreeFold Now?

If you've seen 'The Social Dilemma' then you already understand the very-real concerns around data privacy and security. While the current Internet has plenty of apps, games and gadgets to keep you busy, they come with a few caveats: 

- **"Free" but with a price.**
    - Many of these apps may be free to download and use, but the companies providing these apps track and gather your personal information, online activity, and other data.
    - This data can then be sold to marketers, credit agencies and other third parties without your knowledge or consent.
    - You might think you're getting a free product, but in reality it's the other way around — the product is actually you.
- **Your content, their property.**
    - You spend countless hours creating and sharing content on social media, winning items in games, and building up a following. You'd think you own this digital "property," but think again
    - With most sites and platforms, the companies themselves actually own it, and use it to generate traffic and revenue without you receiving your fair share.
    - And when you close your account or the game is discontinued, you lose your content and your access.

**We created ThreeFold Now in order to us all safe, secure, and private alternatives to the tools and applications we know and love. This marketplace will decentralize our lives.**
