## What is BookStack?

[BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) is "a simple, self-hosted, easy-to-use platform for organizing and storing information." And it's open source!

## Why use BookStack?

We really liked BookStack when we were looking around for a wiki publisher. It's simple but at the same time quite dynamic. Some of its key features include:

- Free & Open Source
- Easy, Simple Interface
- Searchable & Connected
- Configurable
- Multi-lingual
- Integrated Authentification

- & More

You can learn more about these benefits and dig in to the platform on [the BookStack website](https://www.bookstackapp.com/).
