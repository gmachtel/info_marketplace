# Intro

## These Blockchain Solutions bring a new alternative to centralized cloud providers

This is a collection of tools for specific blockchains which allow their node operators and community members to deploy their respective nodes on a true peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure â€“ and in just a few clicks. Some of the benefits for blockchain communities include:

- True IT decentralization (both storage *and* compute)
- More cost-effective than centralized cloud providers
- More privacy and security
- Easier to use and quicker to deploy

## This is just the beginning

We are planning to support more blockchain-based workloads in the future which will benefit the communities listed here and the partners to come. More one-click deployments will be live soon, and developers will also be able to build decentralized applications directly on top of their chosen blockchain using our peer-to-peer storage and compute and our developer tools.
