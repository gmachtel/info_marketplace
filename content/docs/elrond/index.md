# Elrond on ThreeFold

![](./img/elrond1.jpg)


## Joint Mission

Enabling 1-Click deployment solutions for Elrond's staking ecosystem

## About Elrond

[__Elrond__](https://elrond.com/) is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 5-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

## Elrond and ThreeFold

By leveraging the ThreeFold P2P cloud/ 3BOT and its efficeint workload deployment mechanism, Elrond and its community of node operators have the power to easily deploy and run their validator nodes on top of a decentralized cloud infrastrucure, directly from the web, and only in a few steps. 

Elrond node operators help secure, maintain, and expand the Elrond Blockchain, and by using the ThreeFold 3BOT, they have the ability to securely control their containerized node, customize it in their own Staking terms, and help distribute the Elrond  Blockchain across the globe and also in remote areas. 

## Get Started with Elrond

Coming soon:
You will be able to soon deploynd run your own Elrond validator node via the **ThreeFold NOW Marketplace**'s dashboard in a few clicks.
