# Digibyte on ThreeFold

![](./img/digibyte.png)


## Joint Mission

Decentralizing and optimizing IT for the Digibyte node ecosystem

## About Digibyte

[__DigiByte__](https://digibyte.io/) is a rapidly-growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward-thinking development, DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchains in existence with one of the most active communities in the Crypto and Blockchain space.

The DigiByte Foundation is a volunteer-managed organization that operates as a non-profit. They protect and promote the true principles of decentralization and empower DigiByte and its community to establish and maintain a sustainable decentralized world.

## Digibyte and ThreeFold

Through our Partnership with the DigiByte Foundation, we empower the DGB community with a decentralized cloud infrastructure to deploy DigiByte nodes and help secure and expand the DGB network across the geographical edges. 

Anyone can contribute and build upon the DigiByte Blockchain using the ThreeFold P2P cloud and its developer tools that provide significant advantages over centralized cloud providers. Thousands of people are running DigiByte software all across the planet. Any server, computer, tablet or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions. 

Running a DigiByte node on ThreeFold has the following benefits: 

- __Decentralization__. Nodes on the ThreeFold Grid are fully decentralized rather than hosted on commercial servers, meaning more control and autonomy for both you and DigiByte.
- __Security__. Ensure the integrity of the DigiByte Blockchain with the built-in security features of the TF Grid. 
- __Privacy__. Protect your digital identity with the enhanced privacy provided by the 3bot infrastructure in combination with DigiByteâ€™s Dandelion++ privacy protocol. 
- __Cost-Efficiency__. Workloads on the ThreeFold Grid are more efficient and require less energy to operate, meaning lower costs and environmental impact.

## Get Started 

Deploy your own DigiByte full Node in a few steps directly from the web using the [__hosted 3bot__](deploy3bot.grid.tf) or the local 3Bot (3Bot SDK).
