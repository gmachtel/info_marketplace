# DigitalMe

## What is happening ?

The centralised **You** exist in many different places. With all online services you leave a little trail of your data, you leave a little piece of you online identity. And this happens over and over with the centralised services you use.  The worst part is:  You don't own this data the online service provider does.  This needs to change

## What should be done and how are we solving the problem ?

Your online data shoud be yours to begin with and stay yours for the full duration of you online presence.  The services you use should be allowed to "see" your data but not own your data. To achieve this **You** should be put in the center and have a digital online self that has knowledge and capabilities to the things you want to do online.
